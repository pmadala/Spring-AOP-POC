/* Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure. 
 * Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). 
 * If we store keys in binary search tree, 
 * a well balanced BST will need time proportional toÂ M * log N,
 * where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree.
 * Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. 
 * However the penalty is on Trie storage requirements. 
 * 
 * The occurrence attribute represents the number of times a string is inserted into  a trie DS .
